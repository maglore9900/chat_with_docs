This is a pretty simple python script that will allow you to chat with documents using OpenAI or Ollama. It supports command line arguments.

I made this tool because its one of the first things people try to do when they learn they can, and I hope it allows people to quickly see how to do it as well as improve upon it.


To use this tool you simply run it like so
`py main.py -d "test.pdf" -q "what is the first line in this document?"`


At some point I will finish adding the vectorstore options, but it currently doesnt work. Mostly just due to not having time to correct it.
